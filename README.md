# Vitals V1

A web application for intelligent patient vital sign monitoring and analysis, designed for use in medical environments such as hospitals and clinics. The system enables nurses to submit patient vital data, which is then analyzed using built-in AI logic to generate summaries, alerts, and recommendations for doctors, facilitating early intervention and informed decision-making.

## Features

- **Nurse Dashboard:**  
  - Submit vital signs for patients (height, weight, temperature, blood pressure, pulse, pain scale, etc.).
  - Automatic calculation of BMI and data validation.
- **Doctor Dashboard:**  
  - View latest vital sign records per patient.
  - Summaries, critical alerts, and recommendations generated by AI.
- **Patient History:**  
  - View historical vital records for each patient.
- **AI-Powered Analysis:**  
  - Custom logic for analyzing BMI, blood pressure, temperature, and pulse.
  - Generates alerts and recommendations based on clinical guidelines.
  - (Optional) Machine learning model for predicting risk of disease (Random Forest Classifier).

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/blezcherian123/vitals_V1.git
   cd vitals_V1
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure the Database**
   - Set up a MySQL database and update credentials in `config.py`.
   - The application will auto-create required tables on first run.

4. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   - The app runs on `http://localhost:5000/` by default.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- MySQL server

**Python packages (see `requirements.txt`):**
- Flask
- mysql-connector-python
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- python-dotenv

## Usage

- **Nurse:** Enter new patient data or update existing records via the web interface.
- **Doctor:** Review latest patient vitals, summaries, and system-generated recommendations.
- **Patient History:** Accessible through `/patient_history/<registration_id>` endpoint.

## AI & Analysis Logic

- **BMI:** Categorized into multiple risk levels; recommendations provided for underweight or obesity.
- **Blood Pressure:** Classified by the latest hypertension guidelines, with age adjustment for elderly patients.
- **Temperature:** Alerts for fever, hypothermia, or abnormal readings.
- **Pulse:** Evaluated using age-specific ranges for bradycardia/tachycardia.
- **(Optional) Disease Prediction:** Random Forest classifier can be trained on historical data.

## Customization

- Add more features or improve dashboards by editing `templates/` and `static/`.
- Update analysis logic in `ai_module.py`.
- Integrate additional machine learning models as needed.
